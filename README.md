# Prim-s-Algorithm-in-C
Arnav Chennamaneni

Aftre setting up the compiler,
To run this lab, run the following command in the terminal to compile the code:
gcc -o PrimsAlgorith PrimsAlgorith.c
Then run the the following command to run the program:
PrimsAlgorith
(I also wanted to try it in C and not Python so hopefully I don't get lynched)
